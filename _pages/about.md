I'm Chang Zhu - a fourth year Ph.D. student at Arizona State University. I currently work at the [SEFCOM Lab](https://sefcom.asu.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Ruoyu(Fish) Wang](https://rev.fish/), [Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili](https://yancomm.net/), [Dr. Adam Doupé](https://adamdoupe.com/) and [Dr. Tiffany Bao](https://www.tiffanybao.com/). 

My research interests focuses on reverse engineering, machine learning and analyzing security issues in a wide range of topics.
